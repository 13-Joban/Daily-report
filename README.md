
 ## 1 Installed the app and done testing of app:
 
  ### 1.Not able to select files(image , audio, and video) from the device except google photos and albums.
  ### 2. Why Black screen appear if we are not able to select files?.
  ### 3. No Preview of image and audio file.
  ### 4. I choosed image option but I can upload video from albums which is weird.

## 2 Features that can be added:

 ### 1. Button which displays all previous uploads should be more elaborative. We have to implement better call to action for that in the XML file.
 ### 2. New uploaded files must be on the top of list rather than bottom.
 ### 3. When I open the uploaded video I am not able to download the video.
 ### 4. Preview of image and audio file.

## 3 Installation of Andriod Studio 
### 1 Downloaded the android studio currenlty in process
