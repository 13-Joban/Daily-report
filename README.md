 ## 1 Installed the app and done testing of app
 ### 1 . Not able to select files(image , audio, and video) from the device except google photos.
  ### 2. Why Black screen appear if we are not able to select files?.
 ### 3. To see the image we face a problem: Zoom feature can be implemented properly.
 ### 4. I choosed image option but I can upload video from albums which is weird

## Features that can be added:

### 1. Button which displays all previous uploads should be more elaborative. We have to implement better call to action for that in the XML file.
### 2. New uploaded files must be on the top of list rather than bottom.
### 3. When I open the uploaded video I am not able to download the video.
### 4. Preview of image and audio file.
## Installation of Andriod Studio 
### 1 Downloaded the android studio currenlty in process
